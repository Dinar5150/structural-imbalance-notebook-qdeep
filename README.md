# Structural Imbalance Jupyter Notebook

This notebook explains the quantum processing unit (QPU) programming model used for 
calculating structural imbalance in signed social networks, and shows how to implement 
it using D-Wave Ocean's stack of tools. 

By the end of this notebook you will have experienced using Ocean's graphic tools 
to submit a problem to the D-Wave system and be able to modify the code to experiment 
with different data sets and parameters.

## Usage

To enable notebook extensions:

```bash
jupyter contrib nbextension install --user
```

To run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
